    <p>Salon des Refusés ("exhibition of rejects") was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from
    the official Paris Salon. It displayed works by later famous modernists such as Édouard Manet,
    whose paintings were rejected by the conservative jury of the Paris Salon. We feel that a similar space 
    is needed to explore new ideas and new ways of doing programming research and computer science.</p>

    <p>Many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern programming 
    language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using proofs, 
    measurements or controlled user studies. As a result, new ideas are often seen as "unscientific".</p>
    
  </div><div class="col-md-6">
    <p>To provide space for unorthodox thought provoking ideas, we take inspiration from literary
    criticism. Papers that provoked an interesting discussion or criticism among the program committee 
    members were presented together with an attributed critical review that presents an alternative
    position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion about the work.</p>

    <p>In 2017, we accepted the 8 most inspiring papers out of 16 submissions. Below, you'll
    find the revised versions of the papers with critical commentary. We hope both will
    encou&shy;rage you to find new ways of doing and thinking about computer science!</p>

## Topics of interest
The scope of the workshop is determined more by the format of submissions than by the specific 
area of programming language or computer science research that we are interested in. We welcome 
submissions in a format that makes it possible to think about programming in a new way, 
including the following.

</div></div>

<div class="container outlines">
<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

### Thought experiments
We believe that thought experiments, analogies and illustrative 
metaphors can provide novel insights and inspire fruitful programming language ideas.

### Paradigms
All scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm that frame what 
questions can be asked. We encourage submissions that reflect on existing paradigms or 
explore alternative scientific paradigms.

### From jokes to science fiction
A story or an artistic performance may explore ideas and 
spark conversations that provide crucial inspiration for development of new computer science thinking.

### Experimentation
We find prejudices in favour of theory, as far back as there is 
institutionalized science, but programming can often be seen more as experimentation than 
as theorizing. We welcome interesting experiments even if there is yet no overarching theory 
that explains why they happened.


### Metaphors, myths and analogies
Any description of formal, mathematical, quantitative or 
even poetical nature still represents just an analogy. We believe that fruitful ideas can be 
learned from less common forms of analogies as well as from the predominant, formal and 
mathematical ones.

## Programme committee

To help the authors choose topics that would spark interesting discussions among the PC members 
and workshop attendees, we do not just list PC members, but we also include their brief bio below.
You are welcome to use these as an inspiration for your submission, but they are by no means a 
complete list of topics!

If you have any questions or want to check whether your idea would fit, please send email to 
Luke Church (luke at church dot name) or Tomas Petricek (tomas at tomasp dot net) or ping Tomas
at [@tomaspetricek](http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek), or get in touch with any of the other members 
of the committee to discuss your ideas.

#### Antranig Basman, Raising the floor
Antranig wants to see work that widens the audience for software by considering the role it might 
take in healthy societies, based around artefacts that work for everyone. These days, he codes 
exclusively in JavaScript, the language of the proles - in whom our hope lies. He is interested in 
work which challenges the assumptions we use to carve up our domain into separated disciplines. He 
is excited by the possibility that we are still in the prehistory of our subject, and that the 
principles and practices we have adopted so far may be completely faulty.

#### Javier Burroni, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Javier met Smalltalk almost 20 years ago, and that made an influence that still persists in his 
view of programming. He likes to think of Programming Languages as a tool of thought, and their 
relation with the discovery of knowledge.  He is now working with Probabilistic Programming 
Languages implementing new tools to increase our understanding. 

#### Luke Church, University of Cambridge
Luke is a researcher at the University of Cambridge. He studies how to improve the experience that 
people have when dealing with complex systems. For example: programming languages, configuration 
systems or animal behaviour.

#### Patrick Dubroy
Patrick is a programmer and interaction designer based in Munich, Germany. Most recently, he worked 
at Y Combinator Research, doing research at the intersection of programming languages and user 
interfaces. In the past, He also worked at Google, BumpTop, and IBM.

#### Richard Gabriel, Hasso Plattner Institute
Richard P. Gabriel is the Worse is Better guy. He is a Researcher at Leisure investigating computer 
generation of writerly text and poetry as well as artificial consciousness. His official affiliation 
is Visiting Researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute. He is the award-winning author of four books 
and a poetry chapbook. He lives in California.

#### Stephen Kell, University of Cambridge
Stephen thinks that program-ming, as we know it, has unacceptably high human cost, and that we 
cannot solve this problem by escalation. We need programming systems that help us not to write more 
code, but to write less, combine, downsize and simplify code. He is a system-builder, interested 
not only in designing and building such programming systems, but in evolving existing systems in 
this non-traditional direction.

#### Mariana Marasoiu, University of Cambridge
Mariana is a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge in the Computer Laboratory.
Her current work focuses on building tools for creating dynamic data visualisations 
aimed at end user programmers.

#### James Noble, Victoria University of Wellington
James' research focuses primarily on two areas of software engineering: the design of the users' 
interface (the parts of software that users have to deal with every day), and the programmers'
interface (the internal structures and organisations of software that programmers see only when they
are designing, building, or modifying software). His research in both these areas is coloured by his
longstanding interest in object-oriented approaches to design. Topics he has studied range from 
aliasing and object ownership, design patterns, agile methodology, visualisation and computer music, 
through to postmodernism and the semiotics of programming. 

#### David Nolen, Cognitect
David is a curious programmer, musician, and teacher living in Brooklyn. He currently writes Clojure, 
JavaScript and Ruby for Cognitect. He also helps run the affordable Kitchen Table Coders workshops 
from a Brooklyn studio. In his free time he contributes to several open source Clojure projects 
including core.match, core.logic and ClojureScript.

#### Tomas Petricek, Alan Turing Institute
Tomas is interested in work that challenges how we think about programming. He is interested in 
novel programming models, theory and practice of functional programming, tools for data-driven 
storytelling and data science, but also philosophy of science applied to programming.

#### Jack Schaedler, Ableton
Jack is interested in work that aims to make computation more easily appropriable by 
authors, educators, artists, and musicians who wish to communicate their ideas in a dynamic 
medium. He's interested in tools and languages for authoring interactive literature and artwork, 
as well as approaches for ensuring that these works remain accessible to posterity. Jack works 
as a developer for Ableton where he builds software tools for musicians. In his free time, he 
creates online experiences which explore the explanatory and educational potential of 
interactive literature. 

#### Philip Tchernavskij, Université Paris-Sud
Philip programs so that we all might program less. He works on infrastructure for software that 
can be pulled apart and put back together by end-users to fit them and their communities. He is 
trying to make software tools more like analog hand tools, which can generally be selected, 
combined, shared, and altered in ways that we have learned software should not be. Besides 
rethinking the languages and architectures we use to build interactive systems, this involves 
questioning the contemporary roles of designers, developers, and users.
