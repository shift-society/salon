    <p>Salon des Refusés ("exhibition of rejects") was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from
    the official Paris Salon. It displayed works by later famous modernists such as Édouard Manet,
    whose paintings were rejected by the conservative jury of the Paris Salon. A similar space 
    is needed to explore new ways of doing computer science.</p>

    <p>Many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern programming 
    language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate. To provide space for 
    unorthodox thought provoking ideas, we take inspiration from literary criticism. Papers that 
    spark an interesting debate among the program committee are presented together with an 
    attributed critique that discusses the merits of the work.</p>
