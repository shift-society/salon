    <p>Salon des Refusés ("exhibition of rejects") was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from
    the official Paris Salon. It displayed works by later famous modernists such as Édouard Manet,
    whose paintings were rejected by the conservative jury of the Paris Salon. We feel that a similar space 
    is needed to explore new ideas and new ways of doing programming research and computer science.</p>

    <p>Many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern programming 
    language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using proofs, 
    measurements or controlled user studies. As a result, new ideas are often seen as "unscientific".</p>
    
  </div><div class="col-md-6">
    <p>To provide space for unorthodox thought provoking ideas, we take inspiration from literary
    criticism. Papers that provoked an interesting discussion or criticism among the program committee 
    members are presented together with an attributed critical review that presents an alternative
    position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion about the work.</p>

## Topics of interest
The scope of the workshop is determined more by the format of submissions than by the specific 
area of programming language or computer science research that we are interested in. We welcome 
submissions in a format that makes it possible to think about programming in a new way, 
including the following.

### Thought experiments
We believe that thought experiments, analogies and illustrative 
metaphors can provide novel insights and inspire fruitful programming language ideas.

### Paradigms
All scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm that frame what 
questions can be asked. We encourage submissions that reflect on existing paradigms or 
explore alternative scientific paradigms.

### From jokes to science fiction
A story or an artistic performance may explore ideas and 
spark conversations that provide crucial inspiration for development of new computer science thinking.

### Experimentation
We find prejudices in favour of theory, as far back as there is 
institutionalized science, but programming can often be seen more as experimentation than 
as theorizing. We welcome interesting experiments even if there is yet no overarching theory 
that explains why they happened.

### Metaphors, myths and analogies
Any description of formal, mathematical, quantitative or 
even poetical nature still represents just an analogy. We believe that fruitful ideas can be 
learned from less common forms of analogies as well as from the predominant, formal and 
mathematical ones.

</div>
<div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

### (Counter-)Histories
We are inspired by the idea that our field may currently be in its pre-history, and that the practices we have adopted may be completely faulty. 
A counter-history may report on today’s primitive notions of programming from the far future, or on the unfulfilled promise of programming’s past.

### Ironies of Software Design
The ‘best practices’ of programming are motivated by math and engineering virtues such as consistency, correctness, and efficiency. 
These virtues may not be apparent to other communities involved with software, or may go directly against their needs. 
We invite reports on the ironic consequences of virtuous programming, and the ironic successes of ‘improper’ programming.

### Dialogues
The orthodoxies of programming ought to be challenged from outside the field, from the point of view of those that are affected by or excluded from it. 
We invite both insiders and outsiders to submit critical dialogues on programming.

## Programme committee

To help the authors choose topics that would spark interesting discussions among the PC members 
and workshop attendees, we do not just list PC members, but we also include their brief bio below.
You are welcome to use these as an inspiration for your submission, but they are by no means a 
complete list of topics!

If you have any questions or want to check whether your idea would fit, please send email to 
Luke Church (luke at church dot name) or Philip Tchernavskij (ptchernavskij at protonmail dot com) or ping Philip
at [@ptchernavskij](http://twitter.com/ptchernavskij), or get in touch with any of the other members 
of the committee to discuss your ideas.

#### Antranig Basman, Raising the floor
Antranig wants to see work that widens the audience for software by considering the role it might 
take in healthy societies, based around artefacts that work for everyone. These days, he codes 
exclusively in JavaScript, the language of the proles - in whom our hope lies. He is interested in 
work which challenges the assumptions we use to carve up our domain into separated disciplines. He 
is excited by the possibility that we are still in the prehistory of our subject, and that the 
principles and practices we have adopted so far may be completely faulty.

#### Luke Church, University of Cambridge
Luke is a researcher at the University of Cambridge. He studies how to improve the experience that 
people have when dealing with complex systems. For example: programming languages, configuration 
systems or animal behaviour.

#### Stephen Kell, University of Kent
Stephen thinks that programming, as we know it, has unacceptably high human cost, and that we cannot solve this problem by escalation. 
We need programming systems that help us not to write more code, but to write less, combine, downsize and simplify code. 
He is a system-builder, interested not only in designing and building such programming systems, but in evolving existing systems in this non-traditional direction.

#### Clayton Lewis, University of Colorado Boulder
Clayton is Professor of Computer Science and Fellow of the Institute of Cognitive Science, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 
He is well known for his research on evaluation methods in user interface design, and has also contributed to cognitive assistive technology, programming language design, educational technology, and cognitive theory in causal attribution and learning. 

#### Mariana Marasoiu, University of Cambridge
Mariana is a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge in the Computer Laboratory.
Her current work focuses on building tools for creating dynamic data visualisations 
aimed at end user programmers.

#### Midas Nouwens, Aarhus University
Midas is interested in the political economy of software production and consumption, that is, how specific technical characteristics of software help produce particular people, labour conditions, and societies. 
He is currently mostly exploring the consequences of application-centric computing as a distinct paradigm of computational media, as well as looking for ways to use regulation and policy innovation to shift that paradigm into one that is more sustainable, equitable, transparent, and accountable.

#### Tomas Petricek, Alan Turing Institute
Tomas is interested in work that challenges how we think about programming. He is interested in 
novel programming models, theory and practice of functional programming, tools for data-driven 
storytelling and data science, but also philosophy of science applied to programming.

#### Winnie Soon, Aarhus University
Winnie Soon is an artist-researcher-coder-educator who resides in Hong Kong and Denmark. 
Her works explore themes/concepts around digital culture, including internet censorship, data circulation, image politics, code and real-time processing, etc. 
Winnie’s projects have been exhibited and presented internationally at museums, festivals, universities and conferences across Europe, Asia and America. 
Her current research focuses on exploratory and aesthetic programming, working on two books titled “Aesthetic Programming” (with Geoff Cox) and “Fix My Code” (with Cornelia Sollfrank). 
She is Assistant Professor at Aarhus University.

#### Philip Tchernavskij, Université Paris-Sud
Philip programs so that we all might program less. He works on infrastructure for software that 
can be pulled apart and put back together by end-users to fit them and their communities. He is 
trying to make software tools more like analog hand tools, which can generally be selected, 
combined, shared, and altered in ways that we have learned software should not be. Besides 
rethinking the languages and architectures we use to build interactive systems, this involves 
questioning the contemporary roles of designers, developers, and users.
