    <p>Salon des Refusés ("exhibition of rejects") was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from
    the official Paris Salon. It displayed works by later famous modernists such as Édouard Manet,
    whose paintings were rejected by the conservative jury of the Paris Salon. We feel that a similar space 
    is needed to explore new ideas and new ways of doing programming research and computer science.</p>

    <p>Many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern programming 
    language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using proofs, 
    measurements or controlled user studies. As a result, new ideas are often seen as "unscientific".</p>
    
  </div><div class="col-md-6">
    <p>To provide space for unorthodox thought provoking ideas, we take inspiration from literary
    criticism. Papers that provoked an interesting discussion or criticism among the program committee 
    members were presented together with an attributed critical review that presents an alternative
    position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion about the work.</p>

    <p>Below, you'll find the revised versions of papers from 2017 and 2018 with critical commentary. We hope both will
    encou&shy;rage you to find new ways of doing and thinking about computer science!</p>

## The nature of program code

Should we treat program code as a _text_ just like works of literature or as _blocks_ in 
visual programming languages? Does styling and formatting of program code let us express
something more about the program as in a stylized poem, or is it better to eliminate formatting
from our code altogether? The first two papers looks at different ways of thinking and
working with code.

### [Programming is writing is programming](/salon/papers/2017/writing-is-programming-is-writing/paper)

> **Authors**: Felienne Hermans, Marlies Aldewereld<br />
> **Critique**: Tomas Petricek

#### [Paper abstract](/salon/papers/2017/writing-is-programming-is-writing/paper)
Writing and programming are often seen as different: writing a creative profession, 
programming a technical one. Below the surface however, there is one striking similarity.
This paper compares writing and programming and uncovers similarities between some of the steps 
of writing and programming workflows. We also observe differences, like the attention that 
writers spent on formatting and styling, and the opportunity for feedback in programming.

#### [Critique abstract](/salon/papers/2017/writing-is-programming-is-writing/critique)
The paper thus opens an interesting line of thought. What can we say by contrasting
programming with writing? At the surface, writing and programming are both about communicating 
an idea. Programming research often tries to distill such ideas to their core essence. Analogies 
with writing can help us understand the flaws and limitations of this approach. A summary of a 
novel on Wikipedia is not the same thing as the novel. Furthermore, writers often use styling 
and formatting to add a twist to an idea.

### [Code is not just text: Why our code editors are inadequate tools](/salon/2017/papers/code-is-not-just-text/paper)

> **Author**: Gregor Weber<br />
> **Critique**: Felienne Hermans

#### [Paper abstract](/salon/papers/2017/code-is-not-just-text/paper)
The most popular code editors treat code like any other form of text.
This leads to all kinds of problems, from syntax errors to code style 
inconsistencies. Alternative editors, namely visual programming languages, 
are available, but mostly in the form of educational tools and therefore 
have their own set of problems when used productively. But there might be 
a middle ground worth exploring, between the high productivity of traditional 
editors and the constrained interactivity of visual programming languages.

#### [Critique abstract](/salon/papers/2017/code-is-not-just-text/critique)
This paper describes the current state of code editors, and how they could improve. I am 
super happy there is a paper about code editors, of course, since mu interest is in unconventional 
code editors, like Excel and Scratch. When reviewing this paper my attention is mostly drawn not 
to the described solution but to some of the assumptions the author is making. And that is not 
just because the solution is not there yet. There are some assumptions made in the paper that 
have not yet deserved enough attention.
