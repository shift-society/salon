  <p>Writing and programming are often seen as different: writing a creative profession, programming 
  a technical one. Below the surface however, there is one striking similarity: both writing and 
  programming can be described as the translation of a high-level idea into low level sentences 
  or statements. This paper compares writing and programming and uncovers similarities between 
  some of the steps commonly considered part of the writing and programming workflows, such as 
  information gathering and selection. We however also observe differences, like the attention that 
  writers spent on formatting and styling, and the opportunity for feedback that programmers have 
  by compiling and executing programs. We close the paper with a discussion of the impact of this 
  finding, including educational methods that programming could take from writing education.</p>

  <p>Programming has been linked to a wide range of activities including writing, cooking and bridge 
  engineering. Which analogies we pick depends more on what we want to say than on how suitable
  they are. The paper thus opens an interesting line of thought. What can we say by contrasting
  programming with writing? </p>
  <p>At the surface, writing and programming are both about communicating an idea. Programming research
  often tries to distill such ideas to their core essence. Analogies with writing can help us 
  understand the flaws and limitations of this approach. A summary of a novel on Wikipedia is 
  not the same thing as the novel. Furthermore, writers often use styling and formatting to add a 
  twist to an idea.</p>

## 1. Introduction

Writing and programming might seem worlds apart: Writing is a creative activity, with goals ranging 
from entertaining to persuading, from structuring the writer's thoughts to passing a message to the 
reader. Programming, on the other hand, is a form of problem solving, in which the programmer starts 
with a problem, creates a design - a plan of how to solve problem - and then solves this by writing 
code that a machine can execute. But when one takes a look below the surface, there are also clear 
similarities to discover. Most strikingly, both writing and programming can be described as the 
translation of a high-level idea into low level sentences or statements.

In this paper we explore the activities commonly performed in writing and programming with each
other highlighting similarities and differences. For example, in programming, formatting and style 
receive less focus while explicit attention to these has the potential to make code more readable. 
In programming, code is executed and tested early in the process, while text is often proofread 
when more finished.

We believe that both fields can learn from a detailed comparison of activities. What does formatting 
mean in the context of code? Is it important? Can text writing be as iterative and test-driven as 
code? These are just a few of the questions raised by our side-by-side exploration. Does writing 
make you a better programmer? What skills underpin both? Can programming learn from writing education?

## 2. What is writing and what is programming?

So, what is writing? Writing is a way in which humans communicate, using letters and symbols, 
forming words and sentences. It is used for various different reasons and purposes, including but 
not limited to storytelling, correspondence and reports of various kinds. The term 'writing' is 
broad, and can be used for activities varying from the motor skill of forming letters to formulating 
thoughts, feelings and opinions, and to be flawless in the spelling of words and use of grammar 
rules (<a href="#refs">Paus, 2014</a>). In this paper we focus on the activity of text composing, regardless the type 
or genre of the text. 

And what is programming? Programming is commonly seen as the process by which a human formulates a 
problem in such a way that a computer can execute it. It involves understanding the problem, 
creating a design, writing the syntax of a program - sometimes referred to as coding - and 
performing maintenance on an existing program (<a href="#refs">Weinberg, 1985</a>).

## 3. A high level plan executed in detail

One of the most striking similarities between writing and programming is the fact that in both, there 
are high-level plans. A murder mystery writer imagines a killer that stabs blond men with stiletto 
heels; while a programmer imagines an iPad app to manage different bank accounts. These high-level 
plans are sometimes, but not always, formalized to a certain extent. Writers create designs before 
they start. A programmer might draw a UML diagram or an architecture plan, and writer creates a 
table of contents before writing, or uses character sheets and scene descriptions. 

Afterwards, these high-level designs need to be translated into very low level constructs: 
sentences and words for the writers, and methods and lines of code for the programmers. How to 
approach this is a topic for many methodologies in both writing and programming. Is it better to 
draft broadly and then iterate, or to take one chapter or feature and make it perfect before 
adding others? There are people on both sides of the argument in both writing and programming. 
In writing these two extremes even have terms: [Pantsers and 
plotters](http://the writepractice.com/ plotters-pantsers/).

To help manage the complexity of the translation, in both fields, there are intermediate steps. A 
writer divides a story into chapters or an essay into sections. These in turn are divided into 
paragraphs and sentences. Likewise a programmer thinks of classes or objects to contain some 
parts of a program, which have methods and fields in them. 

One aspect where the high-level idea into low-level implementation transformation can lead to 
problems is when changes need to be made. No text is perfect at the first try; books and stories 
are often reviewed and rewritten, sometimes assisted by formal reviews. Programmers review each 
other's code and suggest changes, or fix bugs in existing code bases. In this adaptation, the 
high level translating again plays a big role. If writers decide to remove a character from a 
story, they need to make sure it is deleted from all chapters. If programmers change their 
architecture, this will result in changes to many classes and methods.

## 4. A deep dive into activities

So far, we observed the crux of the similarities between writing and programming: the translation 
of high level ideas into a lower level, the realm of words and letters. We now examine the steps 
of which the activities of writing and programming consist in more detail, drawing comparisons 
and highlight differences. The comparison of steps will help us gain insights into both processes 
better. Where are the procedures similar? Where can we learn from each other? Do we understand 
striking differences?

</div></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-5" markdown="1">

There are a number of models of the writing process available, e.g. ([Huizenga, 2004](#refs)), (Paus 2014), 
([Flower & Hayes, 1981](#refs)), ([Rohman, 1965](#refs)), all similar in the general picture they paint. The 
writing process can roughly be divided in three phases: pre-writing, writing, post-writing, 
which in turn can be divided in two or more sub-phases.  Similarly, the process of writing a 
computer program generally is divided in three phases, resembling the phases in the writing 
process: design, implement, test, or problem solving, implementing, maintaining ([Dale, 1992](#refs)).

There are more fine grained models too, which we will use here to explore the commonalities 
between writing and programming as extensive as possible.

In this paper, we use two more fine grained models, for writing we use ([Huizenga, 2004](#refs))
and for programming ([Prata, 2013](#refs)), both consisting of seven steps, as shown 
in Table 1 (while there are other steps that could be distinguished, we compare these 
two as an exploration of the activities. We do encourage readers to find other sources, or even 
define their own steps on one of the two activities and compare those).

Looking at these steps, we immediately observe similarities, which are graphically depicted in 
Figure 1: _Gathering information_ corresponds to _Defining Program Objectives_, since both relate 
to analyzing the environment of the text or program. The following steps are similar too. _Selecting 
information_ and _Structuring information_ are related to _Designing the program_, since in both 
decisions are made about the underlying, often invisible structure of text and program.

</div></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-5" markdown="1">

After these first three (writing) and two (programming) activities, the differences between the 
models seem to be getting bigger. Where in programming we see the third step _Writing code_, in 
writing, there are three separate steps related to getting the words in their final form: 
_Translating_, _Stylizing the text_ and _Formatting the text_. This level of detail in could be 
one of the areas where programming could learn from writing, maybe it is a good idea to regard 
these steps as different activities in programming too?

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-9" markdown="1">

In programming on the other hand, there is _Compiling_ and _Running the program_. This represents 
a difference between writing and programming, in programming, the programmer gets feedback very 
early on whether the program text is executable, during compiling. Furthermore, they get feedback 
on whether the program is working as intended. One could argue that, in writing, the first 
'execution' of the program happens when someone else reads it, and that it is thus takes longer to 
know whether a text has the desired intend. Of course writers themselves can read the text and 
'execute' it, but the question is if that really executes the text alone. If the writer reads 
the text, can they refrain from also taking into account the context and intentions?

In the remaining sections, we will first discuss the similarities in the first and last steps, 
and then the differences mainly occurring in the middle parts. 

## 5. Similarities

In this section, we zoom in on the similarities in the steps, which mainly occur in 
the beginning and end of the process.

### 5.1 Getting to know the context

The first steps in both fields concern the context of the text and code. What needs to go in? Who 
is the target audience? What do I want my text to convey, or my program to do?

When starting a new project, assignment, or exercise in writing or programming, the first step is 
setting of the goals. What subject must the text be about, or what problem must the computer 
program solve? What kind of text does the writer wants, or has, to write; a fictional story, recipe, 
or maybe a blog on his website? Who is the intended audience and what are the demands of a possible 
client or reader? With these goals in mind, writers start gathering information about the subject. 
They may use various kinds of sources like their own imagination and emotions, experiences of 
others, information found in external sources like books, videos and websites about the subject. 

In programming, the gathering of information is a field of research in itself: requirements 
engineering. There are numerous different techniques for eliciting the requirements from a 
user ([Kotonya, 1998](#refs)), ([Sommerville, 1997](#refs)), ([Pohl, 2010](#refs)).

In this context, we are mainly talking about the process in which software is made for a customer. 
Of course, there are also projects that start because programmers really want to make something 
for themselves, without fixed requirements. Even in that case, a first step will often be gathering 
information, such as which programming language, library or API to use, or what similar system might exist.

### 5.2 Making plans

After the exploration of the context, there is a focus on designing the artifact. What will the 
storyline be? What is the structure of the argumentation? What characters are going to appear in 
what chapters? These contemplations could be comparable to questions like: What will the 
architecture of our system be? What classes and methods will we have? or What programming paradigm 
fits our problem best?

From all the gathered information the writer selects the useful information for this specific task, 
after or even during the information gathering process. Writers choose which information is 
relevant for the reader to understand the story line and also fits the chosen subject of the text. 

The selection of relevant information too is a skill important in programming, again, especially 
in the commercial setting of creating software for an internal or external costumer. Different 
features of the program to be created are classified by importance, for example using the MoSCoW 
model ([Clegg, 1994](#refs)), or user stories are created, which are then grouped into sprints. 
By categorizing important features, programmers are deciding what information is most important 
for the program.

In writing, the gathering of information can be more vague, especially for writers of fiction, 
maybe the gathering is more of inspiration than of information. 
After gathering information and selecting the relevant parts, the writer organizes all information 
in a way that suits his habits in writing and fits the requirements of the text identified by the goals.

Ideas can be collected and structured in various multi- or one-dimensional ways. For example 
using a mindmap which represents relations between concepts, arguments and/or characters. In case 
of a recipe or manual writers may use a flowchart to structure their ideas. They may also provide 
short descriptions for characters, situations or scenery. Once gathered and organized ideas, the 
writer has an abstract representation of the text in mind. 

Structuring in programming means creating a high-level design for a program. In this phase, design 
decisions are made about the program, such as, for example: what programming language and database 
system will be used? What type of software architecture will we follow, for example a 
model-view-controller or a micro-services setup. Lower level decisions are also made, such as what 
classes are needed and how they will related to each other. That is often done using a class 
diagram or an entity relationship diagram when data is being structured.

### 5.3 Translating

In writing, the step following _Structuring information_ is _Translating_: transferring abstract 
concepts to linear natural language. While putting the design into sentences and words, the writer 
has to abide by rules. These rules might be rules of the language, for example, words need to be 
spelled correctly and sentences must be correct grammatically, but may also depend on the context 
of the text, for example in a scientific article, references have to be correct and in an 
persuasive argument, the text structure should be logical. 

Similarly, the programmer now moves from the whiteboard to the keyboard, to start produces lines 
of code which implement the high-level design. Like in writing, the programmer needs to do so while 
applying rules. For example, code must be syntactically correct in order to be compiled or 
interpreted. In addition, some languages have stricter rules about what is allow, like typing 
rules that the programmer must obey.

According to ([Flower & Hayes, 1981](#refs)), in this process, the writer has to juggle different specific 
demands of written language varying from generic and formal, syntactic and lexical to the 
motor tasks of forming letters or typing on a keyboard. For example, when a writer has 
difficulties with the spelling of the words, this process will use up so much of their working 
memory that they have no room to think about the structure of a paragraph. This high 
'cognitive load' has been studied in the context of programming, and programming education, as 
well ([Harms, 2013](#refs)), ([Sweller, 2016](#refs)), ([Shaffer et al., 2003](#refs))}

### 5.4 Reflecting and Reviewing

We will reflect on differences in the remaining steps in the next section, but for now, let's move 
to the final step of writing and the sixth of programming: _Reflecting on text_ and _Testing and 
Debugging_ and _Maintaining and modifying the program_.

After the text is written - and often also during the writing process - the writer reflects on 
their process and product. Are the goals met? Have I lived up the expectations of the assignment 
or client? Is my text readable?

Likewise a programmer reflects: Does my program function as expected? Is this code well-structured 
and free of _code smells_? Here, of course, there is an interesting difference between writing and 
programming, since a programmer can party rely on the computer to validate their program. Firstly 
of course by the compiler and the type-checker in statically typed languages, and later by an 
interpreter and a runtime. Furthermore, programmers increasingly often use tests to ensure the 
correctness of their programs. To find bugs, but also to ensure code quality, programmers sometimes 
use static analysis tools ([Johnson et al., 2013](#refs)).

Failure to compile, to pass all tests, or too many code smells might impose a need for a revision 
of the source code. This type of product-inherent warnings for review is not present in writing 
texts. While this is a clear benefit, this might also reduce the need for or interest in manually 
reviewing the source code, not for functionality, but for readability. Recent systems for 
collaborative programming, like GitHub and their support for code review via pull requests have 
spurred interest in code reviews for readability and maintainability.

These steps seem very similar, as they concern verifying that the text or program performs the task 
it needs to. However, programming has a seventh step, in which the program is maintained.  Often, 
of course, programs are updated after they have been deployed, while books or articles typically 
remain the same.

## 6. Differences

In this section we highlight differences between the models of Huizenga and Prata. As said, there 
exist other, different models, which would lead to different comparisons. These two list are our 
choice, but we encourage others to make more, and different comparisons.

In our lists, we observe that not all steps are as similar as the first and last few steps. In the 
middle, we observe more differences than similarities, which we will elaborate on in this section. 
The most important difference is that in programming, making the source code is just one step: 
_Writing the program_, while in writing, there are two additional steps related to the stylizing 
and formatting of the text. In this section we will elaborate on what these steps mean in writing 
and how they could be interpreted in programming.

### 6.1 Stylizing text

When the ideas of the writer have been translated into text, a writer will apply rules of style. 
For example, an essay has a formal style with longer sentences and advanced jargon, while a 
children's book is written in a cheerful style using simpler words. It is generally agreed upon 
that in order to write a good document, the writer has to apply  a style to an entire document 
consistently, otherwise the text might be harder to understand, or less enjoyable to read. 

Style can also depend on the intended audience of a text. When writing a letter, for example, the 
choice of style is related to the intended addressee. The style of a letter directed towards a 
loved one differs in various ways from the style of an job application letter.

In addition to these type of styles, prescribed by the goal of the text, many writers have their 
own personal style. This personal style might consist of the heavy use of adjectives to describe 
scenery, or the strict avoidance of multiple clauses. Other examples are the use of different 
perspectives, such as first or third person, or the omniscience of a narrator. Such a personal 
style will automatically be applied by the writer throughout the entire text, and therefor differs 
from the above described styles imposed on the writer. 

As the French writer Raymond Queneau shows in ([Queneau, 1981](#refs)), many styles can 
be used to communicate the same content. By using different styles, the atmosphere of the text 
can strongly vary. Writers often experiment with styles to find out which one fits the intended 
feeling best.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show two exercises from Queneau ([source of 
translation](http://altx.com/remix/style.pdf)); Surprise and Hesitation. Readers can check for themselves that 
on every singly line, in every single sentence, the writer has stuck to the chosen style. This 
reflects in specific words (e.g. 'how' in _Surprise_ and 'but', 'don't really' in _Hesitation_), 
types of sentences (short and firm in _Surprise_ and long and intermittent in _Hesitation_) and 
punctuation (exclamation marks in _Surprise_ and dots and question marks in _Hesitation_).

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-9" markdown="1">

Prata's list of steps of programming does consist the style of a program, which of course makes 
it interesting to think of what exactly 'style' would mean in the context of a program. Some 
authors who have explored different styles in programming, for example 
([Lopes, 2014](#refs)). Her book describes a number of different styles to 
calculate term frequency, including continuation passing style, and functional style. 
However, if we look at the steps in programming, we feel this is more related to 
_Designing the program_ than it is to stylizing.

There are however several places in source code where developers have freedom in giving 
'a style' to their code. One of the concepts related to style could be whether or not the 
code has comments. Some programmers feel that good code should explain itself, but many 
also agree that comments are a good coding practice. The most extreme form of this style 
might be the idea of _literate programming_ introduced by 
([Knuth, 1984](#refs)). He envisioned a style of programming in which 
program statements are interspersed with documentation in a natural language, to ease 
in understanding the program. However compelling the idea of literate programming, in 
practice it is not used widely, with the potential exception of 'notebooks' like 
Mathematica or iPython.

Another area where a style can be expressed, is when programmers are selecting keywords. 
Choosing how to name a keyword can be seen as a literary activity, since the programmer is 
defining the role of a variable with meaningful words. Arguably, the programs `x := 5` and 
`total := 5` are executed in the same way by a compiler, but not by the brains of future readers. 
A more elaborate example is shown in Figures 4 and 5. These two programs could be seen as 
different styles of the same programs, embodying the difference between simply presenting 
facts and taking the reader along in a story of what is happening.

</div></div>
<style>.rect pre { margin-bottom:5px; padding:10px; }
.rect pre code { overflow:scroll; overflow-wrap:normal; word-wrap:normal; white-space:pre; }</style>
<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6 figure rect" markdown="1">

```
decimal x = decimal.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
decimal y = decimal.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
deecimal area = x * y;
Console.WriteLine(area);
```

</div><div class="col-md-6 figure rect" markdown="1">

```
// this program calculates the area of a rectangle 
decimal lengthSide = decimal.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); 
decimal widthSide = decimal.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
decimal area = lengthSide * widthSide; 
Console.WriteLine(area);
```

**Figure 5.** A second program printing the area of a rectangle

</div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-9" markdown="1">

While these differences might seem small, keywords are known to play a large role in source code, 
as about three quarters of characters in a code base consist of identifiers ([Lawrie et al., 2007](#refs)). 
Better identifier names correlate with improved program comprehension. For example, 
([Lawrie et al., 2006](#refs)) reports on a study performed with over 100 programmers, 
who had to describe functions and rate their confidence in doing so. Their results show that 
using full word identifiers leads to better code comprehension than using single-letter 
identifiers, measured by both description rating and by confidence in understanding. 

Here, observing differences between writing and programming leads to questions about 
stylizing programs. Could we envision a class of programs which, like fairy tales, always 
have a similar style in all their occurrences? What is a surprising program, or a hesitant 
one? Do they compile to the same output? And can we think of a group of programs which, 
like letters, share a goal, but could be stylized in different ways? What is the difference 
between a personal style and one imposed by the environment or audience?

We believe contemplating these type of questions will make programming as a field richer and 
we encourage readers to come up with style of programs they like to see.

### 6.2 Formatting text

Another step that is missing in Prata's programming steps is formatting. In writing, formatting 
means the writer layouts text, for readability or aesthetic reasons. Formatting text is 
typically one of the last steps in the writing process. A few activities which are commonly 
performed while formatting are adding images and figures to make the text more attractive or 
easier to understand. Or, when the writer wants to draw attention to a specific part of the 
text, they can use add emphasis with font options, such as making text bold, italic or 
changing the font color. 

Sometimes, for example when the text is being published by a publisher, the formatting step might 
be done, partially of fully, by someone other than the writer. 

</div></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">

Figure 6 shows two versions of a diamond poem: in the first draft the text is formatted using 
practical constraints, the writer has only outlined the poem by its requirements (number of 
characteristics of the animal per line), the final version of the text has a different shape 
(diamond), different font, different background color and there are images added.

</div>

**Figure 6.** Two versions of a diamond poem, with different formatting

</div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-9" markdown="1">

Formatting, like stylizing, is an particular interesting concept in programming, since it is often 
seen as an afterthought. This is underlined by the fact that there is no formatting step in 
Prata's model. 

Again of course the question arises that formatting means in the context of programming. In some 
languages, programmers have no freedom in some aspects of formatting. For example, in Python the 
indentation level of the statements is significant, meaning that code in which, for example, the 
body of a loop is not indented does not work.  

Most other languages do not have formatting requirements that strict, but many have formal of 
informal code conventions, from which a deviation is seen as a bad habit. Some people argue that 
these now informal formatting rules should be made mandatory. For example, in 'The best software 
writing', Ken Arnold argues that: 

> For almost any mature language [...] coding style is an essentially solved problem.  I want 
> the owners of language standards to take this up. I want the next version of these languages 
> to require any code that uses new features to conform to some style.
> 
> <p class="author">The best software writing ([Arnold, 2005](#refs))</p>

More than tools used for natural language writing though, tools for programming, called integrated 
developments environments (IDEs) have features that format code automatically. Recently, 
researchers have successfully attempted to learn formatting conventions from a code base, in order 
to increase its consistency automatically ([Allamanis et al., 2014](#refs)).

</div></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

Despite the existence of these required, advised  or automated formatting measures, programmers do 
still have some freedom in the formatting of their source code. As an example, consider the two 
code snippets in Figure 7. 

Both programs are following code conventions, however, they feel different. The distance between 
the declaration and the use of a variable might influence the understandability of a piece of 
source code, or simply the enjoyment with which someone would read it, underlining the importance 
that formatting can have on a program, even within the limited freedom that a programming 
language offers, compared to natural language.

Finally, there is a way in which formatting in programming is richer than in writing, and that 
is _syntax highlighting_: the coloring of lexical tokens in source code text according to a 
certain categorization. For example, coloring keywords blue, variables red and operators black. 
Experiments done with syntax highlighting have shown that it can reduce time needed for a given 
task and reduces context switches. This effect is greater in novice programmers than in programmers 
with more experience ([Sarkar, 2015](#refs)). It would be interesting to see if effects like this exist 
in natural language comprehension as well, for example by using colors to identify part of speech. 

### 6.3 Compiling and running code

A final, seemingly, difference we want to highlight is that in programming, code can be type 
checked, compiled and ran during the development process. While in writing of course writers 
themselves can read the text, and distribute drafts to people, this is not as easy and 
effortless as hitting a compile button. 

This leads to the deep questions of what does it mean for a text to run? Maybe this can only 
happen in the mind of a reader? Or could we envision an algorithm that mimics this, and 
predicts the thoughts and even emotions of future readers?

There are tools that attempt this somewhat, a simple spell checker comes to mind, or the more 
advanced [Hemmingway app](http://www.heming wayapp.com/) which highlights bad writing 
style like long sentences and passive voice. While these are useful, they do not seem to resemble 
the execution of a text in a human's brain very closely yet.

## 7. Implications

The above of course raises the question how this all helps programmers or writers or both. Given 
enough layers of abstraction, all things are similar. I am an object, the computer on which I 
type this is one too. What does that teach us? We however think there are some important takeaways 
from the comparison between writing and programming that we can learn from.

### 7.1 Metaphors shape thinking

Firstly, the way we view programming impacts the field. We personally have found the plotters and 
pantsers views very appealing also for programming, some people like planning, while others want 
to see where the code takes them. The same person might even be plotting sometimes and 'pantsing' 
in other situations. The way programming is currently seen by many,  through the metaphor of 
software creation as "software engineering" feels as designed by and for plotters. Here's a though: 
If we had viewed programming more alike writing from the start, would we have come to agile design 
methodologies sooner?

### 7.2 Impact on education

It is not just the way we think about programming, but also the way we teach it that is greatly 
influenced by the way we see our field, the research programmes we view it through. If we see 
programming as writing, can we learn from writing education? This question warrants a full paper, 
but there are a few directions we see we can learn from. Could we apply these methods to 
programming education too?

#### 7.2.1 Observational learning

For example, the use of _observational learning_, where a teacher or peers demonstrates a task 
before learners attempt it. In writing education in fact, teacher modeling is the most 
prevailing way of using models for learning. Usually in the instructional 
phase ([Koster & Bouwer, 2016](#refs)). In this teaching method the teacher thinks out loud, they explain 
and demonstrates parts of the writing task. Pupils are expected to adopt the line of reasoning 
while executing the writing task. It is shown an effective instructional method to teach 
writing strategies, see e.g. ([Fidalgo et al., 2015](#refs)), (Graham et al. 2005), ([Koster & Bower, 2016](#refs)). 

Modeling is not limited to one or some parts of the writing process, but is a useful method for 
instruction in strategies for every step of the process, from gathering information to reviewing 
the text, see also ([Aldewereld & Hermans, 2017](#refs)). Usually the teacher functions as a mastery model, 
although it is shown that observing coping models (which are not flawless, but experience difficulties 
in the execution of the task and show how they cope with these difficulties) raises the self-efficacy 
of the pupils and enhances their performance more effectively. For weaker pupils, observing 
coping models is more beneficial, for better learners observing better models is 
([Braaksma et al., 2002](#refs)), ([Braaksma et al., 2004](#refs)), ([Koster & Bower, 2016](#refs)), ([Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 1999](#refs)).

This effectiveness of this method is explained by the existence of the mirror neuron system in 
our brain. This system makes the brain demonstrate identical neural activity when we observe 
others performing a task as if we perform the task ourselves, see e.g. 
([Rizzolatti, 2005](#refs)), ([Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004](#refs)). In this way, the brain already 'learns' how 
to perform a task, and primes the execution of similar tasks. 

#### 7.2.2 Course integration
Writing can be taught in isolation, but can also be taught in combination with other topics, 
for example, when pupils are writing an essay about modern history. Research has shown that 
this type of integration is beneficial for both of the topics taught. For example, Romance 
en Vitale combined science courses for grades 1 and 2 (ages 6 to 8) with reading and writing 
assignments, such as writing an overview of learnings and a diary, and reading are 
appropriate science materials. These children performed significantly better than a control 
group on both science and reading ([Vitale & Romance, 2012](#refs)).

In another study compared the effectiveness of two different methods of teaching science: one 
aimed at just teaching science, a second on combined with reading and literacy. In this 
latter group the kids learned to think, speak, read and write like scientists. The control group, 
which is often used and designed by the same university was aimed at performing and learning 
about experiments. The results showed that the experimental group had a better understanding 
of what science is, a better understanding of the basic concepts and also they identified 
more as scientist ([Girod & Twyman, 2009](#refs)).

This last study could prove especially interesting for programming education, as it also 
could help a broader group of kids identify as programmers!

## 8. Concluding remarks

In this paper, we aim to draw a comparison between writing and programming by comparing their 
goals and challenges. Looking from a distance, both can be seen as having a very high level 
idea and representing that with low level constructs. We observe that some steps as defined 
by writing and programming authors are similar, _Structuring information_ is like 
_Designing program_, in that for both the performers need to take in information and decide 
on how to structure it to fit their goal best. We would love to explore our beliefs further 
in the future, for example by conducting a think aloud study with people writing or 
programming, or by placing people in an fMRI scanner and measure their brain activity. 

Other steps present in writing, like _Stylizing_ and _Formatting_, are not commonly described 
and studied in programming, and we hope our paper leads to more discussion on these activities 
in programming. Is adding whitespace style or is it formatting? Having clearly, agreed upon 
definitions like in writing can ease teaching and communication on these type of topics.
Can we learn from best practices in writing? The other way around, programming has explored 
the step of reflecting and adapting in more detail probably due to the collaborative nature 
of modern day programming projects. There writing could be inspired by ideas like pull 
requests and formal code reviews.

There are also places where writing could be inspired by programming: Programmers attempt to 
get feedback from the "environment" earlier than writers, by compiling and running their 
program. Can writers similarly somehow have a machine reflect on their text while they are 
still writing?  

There are certain things that we consider out of scope for this paper. For example, in the 
above, we have followed ([Huizenga, 2004](#refs)) and ([Prata, 2013](#refs)) in their linear 
representation of writing and programming, but often, in both domains, the processes can 
also be represented as a cycle. For example, in writing the consensus is that writers 
continuously switch between the steps of the process as described above. In programming a 
cycle that is often referred to is Beck's Test Driven Development cycle ([Beck, 2003](#refs)). We 
presented the cognitive processes and skills in a linear way, but the reality is not so 
strict. The process is not even cyclic, although this fits reality more than a linear 
representation. In reality the writer or programmer switches between writing or programming 
stages freely and uses different skills throughout the entire process.

Future work in exploring this comparison should surely examine the cyclic (or even messier) 
order of steps in more detail. There is one more observation: the fact that the activities 
are similar leads us to think that also the skills and the way we teach could learn from 
each other.
